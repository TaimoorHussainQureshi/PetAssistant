# 🐾 Pets Assistant

**AI-powered veterinary behavior companion** built with Streamlit and OpenAI. Pets Assistant turns your cat’s behavioral history into a clear, actionable clinical summary—so you arrive at the vet fully prepared and confident.

## 📖 Description

Pets Assistant guides you through a friendly, 10-question interview about your cat’s habits, quirks, and concerns. After each answer, it asks one empathetic, context-aware follow-up to capture every nuance. When the conversation is complete, you’ll get a one-paragraph summary that’s ready to print or share with your veterinarian—no more scrambling for details in the waiting room.

**Why it matters:**  
- **Clarity & Confidence**: Document your pet’s story precisely, reducing miscommunications at the clinic.  
- **Efficiency**: Vet visits go smoother when you arrive with a structured behavioral report.  
- **Customizable & Extensible**: Swap in your own questions or add new “tools” via decorated Python functions.
